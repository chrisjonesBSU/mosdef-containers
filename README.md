# MoSDeF Containers
This repository includes Docker files for the [Molecular Simulation Design Framework (MoSDeF)](https://mosdef.org/)

Pre-built Docker containers can be pulled from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/chrisjonesbsu/mosdef-containers/general).

## Notes
The `mosdef_stable` image provides the complete MoSDeF software stack and its depdencies plus signac, but does not include the simulation engines that MoSDeF interfaces with.
We provide images that build on top of `mosdef_stable` and also package a single simulation engine. 

A summary of of the Docker images are as follows:
| Image | Main Software | Notes |
|----------|----------|----------|
| mosdef_stable | mBuild, GMSO, Foyer, signac | Includes the latest conda-forge releases for each package. |
| mosdef_hoomd_gpu | mosdef_stable + Hoomd v5.1 | Compiled for Nvidia GPUs and single-precision. HPMC, DPCD, and MPI are disabled. |
| mosdef_lammps_gpu | mosdef_stable + Lammps | Compiled for Nvidia GPUs and single-precision. MPI is disabled, and only basic Lammps plugins and features are included. |
| mosdef_gromacs_gpu | Coming Soon | |
| mosdef_gomc_gpu | Coming Soon | |
| mosdef_cassandra | Coming Soon | |

[Docker Install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) **|** [Docker Get Started](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) **|** [Podman Install](https://podman.io/docs/installation) **|** [Podman Get Started](https://podman.io/get-started)

If you want to use these containers on a personal computer (as opposed to a compute cluster), using Docker or an equivalent, such as Podman, would be best.  


<details>
<summary>üê≥ Docker Example</summary>

**Pull the container from DockerHub**

```bash
docker pull chrisjonesbsu/mosdef-containers:mosdef_stable-2025-04-02
```

**See docker images available locally**
```bash
docker images
```

**Start an interactive shell with the container**
```bash
docker run -it chrisjonesbsu/mosdef-containers:mosdef_stable-2025-04-02
```

<summary>ü¶≠ Podman Example</summary>

**Pull the container from DockerHub**

```bash
podman pull docker.io/chrisjonesbsu/mosdef-containers:mosdef_stable-2025-04-02

```

**See docker images available locally**
```bash
podman images
```

**Start an interactive shell with the container**
```bash
podman run -it chrisjonesbsu/mosdef-containers:mosdef_stable-2025-04-02
```
</details> 


Note: Often times, Docker requires running with root privleges (i.e., using `sudo`).


### Using apptainer
<img src=".images/apptainer.svg" width=300/>

[Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) (formely Singularity) will allow use of these containers in high-performance computer clusters.
Using containers for computational scientific research ensures you are following best practices for reproducibility.
Apptainer is often available as a module on computer clusters and can be used to pull and run Docker containers. If you only have Singularity available, the commands should be the same, except replace `apptainer` with `singularity`.

**Pull the container from DockerHub and use it to run a python file**
```bash
module load apptainer/1.2.5
apptainer pull mosdef_hoomd_gpu.sif docker://chrisjonesbsu/mosdef-containers:mosdef_hoomd_gpu-2025-04-03
apptainer exec --nv mosdef_hoomd_gpu.sif python hoomd_simulation.py
```

To create a local image file (.sif) the command is `apptainer pull name-of-local-image-file source-of-image`.
The `apptainer pull` command grabs an image hosted on DockerHub and creates a new file stored locally.


Next, to use the image file, the command is `apptainer exec --nv path-to-image-file executable path-to-script` where `mosdef_hoomd_gpu.sif` is the file created by `apptailer pull`, `python hoomd_simulation.py` is the command to be ran in the container.
The `--nv` flag is only needed to ensure apptainer passes Nvidia information and resources to the containerized environment.

## More HPC and Research-based Examples 
The above are simple examples to illustrate how to pull an image and run a command with the image.
Examples that are more applicable to performing research are provided in [examples](examples).
These show how to use `apptainer` within a slurm submission script or within a [signac](https://docs.signac.io/en/latest/) project.
See the `README.md` files within the examples for each for more information.
